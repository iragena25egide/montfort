            <strong>Montfort Secondary School, Nyamata</strong>, was founded by 
            the Montfort Brothers of St. Gabriel, a Catholic congregation known 
            for its dedication to education and missionary work across the globe.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4 font-sulphur">
            Established in the heart of Bugesera District, Eastern Province, 
            Rwanda, the school opened its doors with a mission to provide 
            academic excellence and moral education to young learners. From 
            its humble beginnings, it has grown into one of the country's most 
            prestigious schools.

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4 font-sulphur">
            Over the decades, Montfort Secondary School has faced and 
            overcome numerous challenges, including rebuilding efforts during 
            Rwandaâ€™s post-genocide recovery period. These efforts were made 
            possible through the unwavering support of the Montfort Brothers 
            and the local community.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 font-sulphur">
            Today, Montfort continues to uphold its legacy of academic 
            excellence and holistic education. It stands as a beacon of hope, 
            discipline, and opportunity for students across Rwanda and beyond, 
            preparing future leaders to shape a better world.
